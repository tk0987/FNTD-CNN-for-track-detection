CerberCNN for semantic segmentation


Three interconnected "necks" joining the body. 
A lot of connections allowing fast learning, guaranting small model size.

Cerber is learning fast. But... Cerber likes eating RAM. 

For now, with such generated training dataset, it acts like filter for inhomogeneities other than 2D gaussian "dots/ellipses".
